# BJIT_project: Car vs Bike Classification

**BJIT Project Tasks:** 
1. Create a GitHub repository on your own account.
2. Organize the code from the notebook then push the code to the repository.
3. Develop a desktop application that includes an option to input an image and a feature to classify it.

## Required Software and Libraries:
1. Python
2. Pycharm IDE
3. pytorch
4. matplotlib
5. Tkinter

### Used Dataset: [Car vs Bike Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/utkarshsaxenadn/car-vs-bike-detection-resnet50v2-acc-99-88)

### Description:
- A data directory is created in the Pycharm IDE.
- Three python files- train, test and evaluation are created inside the directory.
- In each python files there are two seperate data files for Car and Bike.
- The dataset is divided unto 3 parts and kept in the 3 python files in the directory.
- Data preprocessing is done after importing the necessary libraries.
- The dataset is then trained using the model ResNet50V2 and then evaluated.
- The test result of the model gave an **Accuracy of 98%**.
- A UI is created using Tkinter of Python.
- The desktop application worked properly and gave accurate results of the classification.
